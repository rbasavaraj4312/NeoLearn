# NeoLearn 

## 🔍 Project Overview:
Developing a web-based platform to address the lack of hands-on technical skills and limited collaboration among engineering students. The system empowers both students and teachers by providing secure coding environments, project tracking, and communication tools to enhance academic productivity.

## 💡 Motivation:
During my college years, I observed that many students complete assignments passively - while watching TV or chatting with friends - without building real skills. Even in the final year, many classmates lacked a resume or teamwork experience. This inspired me to build a platform that promotes active learning, peer collaboration, and faculty engagement.

## 🛠️ Key Features:
 -  Secure Coding Environment with test cases and tab/copy-paste restrictions.
 -  Resume Builder for creating clean, ATS-compliant resumes quickly.
 -  Hackathon Team Hub for posting and joining skill-based collaboration calls.
 -  Project Collaboration Module where students and teachers track project progress and milestones.
 -  Lab Exam System with auto-evaluation and strict timer control.

## 🎯 Impact (Expected):
 -  Increases real coding practice and learning outcomes.
 -  Simplifies resume building for job readiness.
 -  Connects students across branches for team-based participation.
 -  Strengthens teacher-student interaction for project guidance.
 -  Reduces manual effort in lab exam evaluation.
